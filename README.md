# Treespace Contracts
This repository contains all the cotracts for the treespace protocol which is currently under development. 
## Structure 
Treespace consists of 3 different components.
- ERC721 Contract
- Marketplace Contract
- Governance Contracts
### ERC721 Contract
All NFTs tradable on the treespace marketplace are minted on this contract. Minting is permissioned by default but can be changed by the DAO. Addresses which are permitted by the Contract to mint are stored in an array.
